# Moca

Official Golang implementation of the Moca Blockchain. It uses [cometbft](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/)
for consensus and build on [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

Moca aims to facilitate the decentralized data economy by simplifying the process of storing and managing data
access, as well as linking data ownership with the massive DeFi context of the other EVM-compatible blockchains.

Moca operates through three core components, which distinguish it from existing centralized and decentralized
storage systems:

- It enables ethereum-compatible addresses to create and manage data and token assets seamlessly.
- It provides similar API primitives and performance as popular existing Web2 cloud storage systems.

These features offer a novel and innovative approach to decentralized data management and ownership in the DeFi space.
Overall, Moca presents a promising solution for bringing greater flexibility, control, and efficiency to users
in the decentralized data economy.

## Moca Core

The center of Moca are two layers:

1. A new storage-oriented blockchain, and
2. network composed of "storage providers".

This repo is the official implementation of Moca blockchain.

The blockchain of Moca serves a dual purpose of maintaining the ledger for users as well as the storage metadata
as common blockchain state data. The blockchain has its native token, MOCA,
and is utilized for gas and governance functionalities. Governance is further enabled through the staking logic that is
unique to the Moca blockchain.

The Moca blockchain has two categories of states that are stored on-chain:

1. The ledger of accounts and their MOCA balance.

2. The metadata of the object storage system and service providers, along with the metadata of the objects stored on the
storage system, permission and billing information pertaining to the storage system.

Transactions on the Moca blockchain have the ability to modify the aforementioned on-chain states. These states and
the transactions that affect them are at the core of the economic data on the Moca platform.

Users looking to create or access data on Moca may do so by engaging with the Moca Core Infrastructure
through decentralized applications known as Moca dApps. These dApps provide a user-friendly interface for
interacting with the platform, enabling users to create and manipulate data in a secure and decentralized environment.

## Documentation

Visit our official [documentation site](https://digitalpulse.larksuite.com/docx/Y1padLPYWop4wvxjgtbu4hEZsXd) for more info.

More advanced script and command line usage, please refer to the [Tutorial](https://digitalpulse.larksuite.com/docx/Y1padLPYWop4wvxjgtbu4hEZsXd#share-J07cdQjtZoN949x9Truu6z0RsQb).

## Key Modules

- `x/evm`: bridges Ethereum's smart contract capabilities with Cosmos' cross-chain functionality and governance systems.
- `x/challenge`: generate random data challenge events or accept user's data challenge requests.
- `x/payment`: handle the billing and payment of the storage module. User fees are paid through "Stream" on Moca,
  with a constant rate of payment from users to Storage Providers (SP) with charges applied every second of usage.
- `x/sp`: manage the various storage providers within the network.
- `x/storage`: users can manage their storage data through this module, like create/delete bucket,
  create/delete storage object.
- `x/permission`: user can manage its resource permission through this module, like put/delete policy for storage
  object.

And the following modules are in cosmos-sdk:

- `x/crosschain`: manage the cross chain packages, like store/query/update the cross chain package, channels, sequences.
- `x/gashub`: provide a governable and predictable fee charge mechanism.
- `x/oracle`: provide a secure runtime for cross chain packages.
- `x/staking`: based on the Proof-of-Stake logic. The elected validators are responsible for the security of the moca
  blockchain. They get involved in the governance and staking of the blockchain.

Refer to the [docs](https://digitalpulse.larksuite.com/docx/Y1padLPYWop4wvxjgtbu4hEZsXd) to dive deep into these modules.
